## On-chain or off-chain certificate/claim proof

Blockcert is doing off-chain verification, that means all users who wants to verify data have to run the program or institutes will need to host these web app for them to use. 

On-chain verification using smart contract will allow participants to use any web-app that can interface with smart contracts to verify a certificate. This will require this to be implemented on a blockchain which supports smart contract though.
